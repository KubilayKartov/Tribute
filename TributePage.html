<strong> Kanye Omari West A.K.A Kayne West </strong>
Kanye Omari West (/ˈkɑːnjeɪ/; born June 8, 1977) is an American rapper, record producer, and fashion designer.[3] Throughout his career,
West has been responsible for cultural movements and musical progressions within mainstream hip-hop and popular music at large.
[4] Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, he was first known as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing singles for several
mainstream artists. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, West released his debut album The College Dropout in 2004 to critical and commercial success,
and founded the record label GOOD Music.

West experimented with a variety of musical genres on subsequent acclaimed studio albums, including Late Registration (2005),
Graduation (2007), and 808s & Heartbreak (2008). Drawing inspiration from maximalism and minimalism, respectively,
West's fifth album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010) and sixth album Yeezus (2013) were also critical successes.
He went on to release The Life of Pablo (2016), Ye (2018), and Jesus Is King (2019). West's discography also includes the
full-length collaborations Watch the Throne (2011) and Kids See Ghosts (2018) with Jay-Z and Kid Cudi, respectively.

West's outspoken views and life outside of music have received significant media attention. He has been a frequent source of
controversy for his conduct at award shows, on social media, and in other public settings, as well as for his comments on the music and
fashion industries, U.S. politics, and race. His Christian faith, as well as his marriage to television personality Kim Kardashian,
have also been a source of media attention.[5][6] As a fashion designer, he has collaborated with Nike, Louis Vuitton, and A.P.C. on both clothing and footwear,
and have most prominently resulted in the Yeezy collaboration with Adidas beginning in 2013. He is the founder and head of the creative content company DONDA.

West is one of the world's best-selling music artists, with more than 20 million albums and 140 million singles sold worldwide. He has
won a total of 21 Grammy Awards, making him one of the most awarded artists of all time.[7][8][9] Among his other awards include the Billboard Artist
Achievement Award, a joint-record three Brit Awards for Best International Male Solo Artist and the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award.
[10] Six of his albums have been included on Rolling Stone's 2020 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list; the same publication named him one of the 100
Greatest Songwriters of All Time.[11] West is the tied holder for the most albums (four) topping the annual Pazz & Jop critic poll. Time magazine named
him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2005 and 2015.
